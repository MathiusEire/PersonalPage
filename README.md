Hello :)

This is the code for my personal portfolio and experience page.

built on React as a way to practice my web dev skills.

Anyone is more than welcome to grab and use this code as I learned through tutorials on Youtube like everyone else.

The page itself won't run on GitHub pages so you'll need to either rent a web service or run it locally (My next project is to try and set up a localised service myself to host the website for backend experience :) )

happy Coding!
